**Tech Stack & Resources I Use**
I work as a full-stack web developer using a classic and reliable LAMP-based workflow. My development process includes building complete web applications from the ground up — covering frontend, backend, and database layers.

**1)Core Technologies**
  1.1)PHP – Primary backend language for building dynamic web applications, business logic, authentication, authorization, and role-based permission systems.
  1.2)MySQL – Relational database used for storing user accounts, roles, privileges, and all CRUD-driven data operations.
  1.3)HTML5 – Semantic markup for structuring pages and application layouts.
  1.4)CSS3 – Styling, responsive layouts, and UI design for clean and user-friendly interfaces.
  1.5)JavaScript (basic use) – Used only when static or lightweight interactive elements are needed; I avoid heavy JS frameworks unless necessary.

**2)Development Environment**
  2.1)XAMPP – Local development environment running Apache, PHP, and MySQL.
  2.2)Visual Studio Code – Main code editor for writing and managing application files.
  2.3)phpMyAdmin – Database management tool for creating schemas, tables, indexes, and managing relational data.

**3)Deployment Context**
Even though I develop on Windows locally, my applications are typically deployed to Linux-based servers, which host:
  3.1)Apache
  3.2)PHP runtime
  3.3)MySQL/MariaDB database
This makes my workflow closely aligned with the traditional LAMP stack commonly used for production environments.

**4)What I Build**
  4.1)Authentication & authorization systems
  4.2)Role-based access control (RBAC)
  4.3)CRUD dashboards and admin panels
  4.4)Database-driven web applications
  4.5)Secure and optimized backend logic
  4.6)Clean and responsive front-end layouts
